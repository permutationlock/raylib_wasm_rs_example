# Raylib

A simple cross-platform Rust wrapper around some of the functionality
of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). Also included is an
[emcc](https://emscripten.org) compiled library file of
Raylib so that this crate should automatically work when included in
builds targeting **wasm32-unknown-emscripten**.
